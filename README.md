# hashtable
 * Project5 creates a hashtable of countries utilizing separate chaining to handle collisions and countries are based on a file, Countries5.csv. 
 * Countries are hashed using their Unicode value and inserted last if a collision occurs. 
 * A menu will be repeatedly printed providing the user with different tasks to perform based on their input. Or they may enter 6 to exit the program.
